# Python Project 1 - Extracting Data

## Background

We all know how COVID-19 pandemic has reached our live and made us to acquire a new lifestyle... 
After being in this scenary for over nine months, we all know that there is a new "normal" going on and, thinking of how things used to be we wonder 
whether the Real Estate Market has been affected by the pandemic or better, how much it has been affected?

So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:

## Note: this project is based in the following instructions:

1. Group effort: working closely with your teammates is a requirement
2. Project Proposal: group should outline the scope and purpose of your project.
3. Finding Data: you are free to use data from any source but high-quatily data. 
4. Data Cleanup & Analysis: we recommend focusing your analysis on techniques such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis. Be sure that your projects meet the technical requirements.
5. Presentation: you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.

## Real Estate Market & Covid-19: what's the impact?!

This project looked at some of the figures that could impact the real estate market due to the pandemic, such as:

1.   Number of covid cases (bar graph)
2.   Number of covid cases (line graph)
3.   Fluctuation of house price (line graph) 2 lines for each year
4.   Number of houses sold in Ontario per month (bar graph) 2020 and 2019 – Connected bars for each year Interest rate fluctuation (line graph)
5.   Covid cases vs. interest rate – I am working on this along with linear regression
6.   Covid cases vs. house sold – I have that ready
7.   Covid cases vs. house price  - I have that ready
